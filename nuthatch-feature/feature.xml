      Nuthatch/J is a library for software transformation and analysis,
based on tree walking.

Transformations are described as walks that proceed in programmer-defined
steps. Each step may which may observe join points of a traversal,
and affect state associated with the walk and also rewrite the
walked tree. Each step ends by walking to a different node in
the tree, following the tree branches.

This package contains the core Nuthatch/J library.
